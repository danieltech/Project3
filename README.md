-----------------

The instructions for opening the game are simple. The user just need to open index.html file and all the modules and
javascript files will be loaded automatically. ALL THE FILES MUST BE DOWNLOADED IN ORDER FOR THE GAME TO WORK.

How to play the game:

the user will start at the bottom of the square. The direction keys are the keyboard arrows. The user will be able to move
among all the squares, but the bugs will only be able to move in horizontal and between 3 rows. The moment the user has a
collision with one bug, the game resets the user position to the bottom area.
